Official To-Do List.

Key:
[+] - Completed/Done
[=] - In Progress
[-] - Incomplete/Not Done

Here's an example of what a proper list item should look like:
'- [-] This is how to make a proper list item.'

When you add an item to the to-do list, please do not forget to add the status symbol ('[-]') to the left of it,
but not before the beginning dash. When a task is completed you should replace the dash inside the status symbol with
a plus sign like so:
'- [+] This is how to make a proper completed list item.'

To add a sub-item to the list, please add a new line and indent it to 6 spaces (from the starting point, not past the
beginning of the list item), then add the status symbol and a space. From that point you may describe the sub-item.

Here's an example of what a proper list sub-item should look like:
'- [-] This is how to make a proper list item.'
'      [-] This is how to make a proper list sub-item.'      

Please use proper grammar when adding items to the list, and to make a comment to the list do as you would do in the
Java programming language: Make a new line, indent it by 3 spaces, add two forward-slashes ('//') with one extra 
space at the end, and then add the text to your comment.

Here's an example of what a proper list comment should look like:
'- [-] This is a list item!'
'   // This is a comment!'

If you feel like doing so, you may make a comment stating who a task was completed by.

Please do not forget to keep this updated! While 'list.txt' still a document it has feelings!

Thanks for reading this gigantic block of text, sorry it was so long!

THIS IS THE DARK SIDE OF THE LIST, THE MESSY PART. PLEASE PUT ANY UNORGANISED BULLSHIT HERE:

[01:42] <DesertRock> Jeviny_Web: Tips for making me apperciate your project: 1) What language language? 2) Purpose? 3) Example of usage 4) Link to online documentation. If those things aren't on the Readme.md, I tend to avoid using the library.

Let's listen to this guy.
