MERCury is a project that I started a while back for my own education on opengl. It was fun to code the batcher, and add in everything. Then I posted it, and people liked it. So I expanded, and even got some friends to help out! We have been working together on networking, GUI, and other fun stuffs.

Our goal is simple: create an engine that can have plugins, and be ultra-flexible yet easy to use.

Sincerly,
