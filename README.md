MERCury is a project that I started a while back for my own education on opengl. It was fun to code the batcher and add everything that I put onto it. When I posted it, people liked it, so I expanded and even got some new friends to help out! We have been working together on networking, GUI, and other fun stuffs.

Our goal is simple: to create an ultra-flexible but easy-to-use engine that can run plugins.
