Maitenance Enhanced and Reliable Coding Engine
          designed by Team Radirius

# The Info

MERCury is a project that I started a while back for my own education on OpenGL. I got started by coding the batcher and adding features like vertex stacking and sound capabilities to the library. I was off to a fun start. When I posted it, people liked it, so I expanded and even got some new friends to help me out! We have been working together on networking, GUI, and other fun stuffs.

Our goal is simple: to create an ultra-flexible but easy-to-use video game library that includes support for plugins.

Sincerely,
Wessles, Founder of Team Radirius

# The Future

We hope to expand upon this library over time and hopefully create something that everybody can use with ease. One day there will come a point where we start support for 3D graphics, one day there will come a point where we can make a full game engine out of what we have put into this library, and one day people might not even use this for general game development. We have a bright future ahead of us.

# The Present

Currently, we have a simplistic 2D game library that is capable of handling basic plugins, minimal GUIs, and includes decent support for networking. We have a well-built rendering engine that is currently capable of doing all of the processes you would need to do to draw out a 2D game in real time, all using the power of OpenGL. We plan on adding more engine-like features and we hope to completely rewrite our plugin system. All of what we are doing is experimental, so we love getting new ideas and support from the community!
