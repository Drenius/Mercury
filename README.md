MERCury is a project that I started a while back for my own education on opengl. I got started by coding the batcher and adding features like vertex stacking and sound capabilities to the game library. I was off to a fun start. When I posted it, people liked it, so I expanded and even got some new friends to help me out! We have been working together on networking, GUI, and other fun stuffs.

Our goal is simple: to create an ultra-flexible but easy-to-use video game library that includes support for plugins.

Sincerely,
Wessles, Founder of Team Radirius

We hope to expand upon this library over time and hopefully create something that everybody can use with ease. One day there will come a point where we start support for 3D graphics, one day there will come a point where we can make a full game engine out of what we have put into this library, and one day people might not even use this for general game development. We have a bright future ahead of us.
