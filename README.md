Libgdx, and slick2d. Those are both GREAT libraries, way more than this will ever be.

However...

That is why I made this. Sure, they are great, but they are LARGE. They have tons of utilities that few people use, like Slick2d's TileMap class. MERCury is compact, and gets the job done still at a high framerate.

You can stick to libGDX, Slick2d, but if you want a small lib/engine, you have to look around (as you could guess, smaller engines/libs are less popular).

But I am not pitching this to you, I am sharing my progress on this project. This is for my learning benifit. If it comes in handy for you, then I feel like I have accomplished that much more!
