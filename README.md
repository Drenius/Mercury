So, I decided that it would give me a good sense of what to do with the coding parts of games if I attempted to make my own game library. This is my first try at one. It isn't libGDX, but so far looks like it will work for me, and maybe others(?).

**Because this is my first try at a game library, I am open to all criticism.**

MERCury is a small game library designed to simplify the complex, and shorten the tedious for beginners and veterans alike. With it, you can use the best aspects of OpenGL in an easy and organized way optimized for game programming. It is built around the concept that beginners should be able to start with the basics, and move up into a more complex plane of development with the veterans, all on the same platform.

MERCury puts all of its resources into keeping things short and simple. The initial setup of a game consists only of making a single class; then you are done. The interface is entirely documented for easy and fast learning, so once you are started, there is nothing between you and the end result but coding and creativity.

MERCury is developed by a small team of programmers who just want to learn how to make something useful. We all have a lot of fun developing it, and it would be our pleasure to hear that someone actually found it useful, so please contact us with anything you have for us. MERCury's TODO list is driven purely by the will of the users so if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask!
