Mercury is a game library designed to simplify the complex and shorten the tedious for both the beginning and the experienced. With it, you can make use of OpenGL in an easy and organized way optimized for game development. It's built so that both beginners and newcomers to game development are able to start with the basics and then move up onto a more complex plane of development with the veterans, on the same platform.  

Mercury sticks to keeping things short and simple. The initial setup of a game consists only of making a single class; then you are done. The interface is entirely documented for easy and fast learning. Once you get started, there is nothing between you and your killer game except coding and creativity. 

Mercury is entirely built around the wishes of its users, so please do not hesitate to suggest and critique!
